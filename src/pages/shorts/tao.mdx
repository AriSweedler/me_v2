# The tree and the root

Butterfly effect - an absolute evil, and an absolute good.

Such a strong knowledge of the way of the world that they can cause any possible
situation to happen, with mere perturbations in the wind from their breath.

So if they have conflicting goals, what then will happen? Will the first
undertsand what the second wants? And how he goes about doing so? And be able to
make those outcomes an impossibility?

Or will the second, upon seeing the visitor, at once immediately understand the
motivations and actions of the first, and be able to shape the world to his
will, as per usual.

The tree says that whoever you talk to first gets to decide all - as there is
nothing more important than a strong foundation. There is nothing in a tree that
does not stem from its roots, and there is nothing on the Earth without the sun.

The root says that whoever you talk to second gets to decide all - as there is
no time more important than the present. The past is written in stone,
unchangeable, but there are an unbounded amount of oppportunities in the
present.

What a bunch of nerds
