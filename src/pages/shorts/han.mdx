### I can ... try

Like, you ever just have the mindset "Ok, Han. This sucks. But head down, and
finish it. Itâ€™s almost over. The benefits are very high, the cost is very low"

That's kinda how I felt about certain parts of my personality

They were incredibly useful for school. Sit down, shut up, grind, smile, don't
get mad at the assholes, stay energetic

But those are not me, at least, not naturally. That's not how I'd act in a
vacuum. That's how I'm acting to survive a system. So now that I've survived
this system, my goals remain the same, but my behavior has changed.

## But I should give a concrete example

Landlords

Landlord says "you have to pay $X/month more"

Please take these as truth:
<ol>
<li>for a small number, like $0.01, no one would argue, or even care. And
similarly</li>
<li>for a large number, like $1,000, everyone would argue.</li>
</ol>

In college, my line might have been $50. But now? It's probably something like
$5.

Concrete numbers aside, my line is different.

## Why is my line different
Because I don't think that everything is looking out for me.

When I was told to sit down and shut up, it used to be so that I could be taught
something. Now, if I'm told to sit down and shut up, it's possible that
someone's taking advantage of my naivety.

So I am less likely to sit down and shut up when told to do so. I am less likely
to follow a system that I don't understand. Because I can provide for myself
better than the systems I'm a part of can provide for me.

Elementary school treated unintelligent and unconscious Ari very well. College
only treated intelligent and conscious Ari well.

# So...
**I am less likely to feel like I'm doing the wrong thing when I stand up for
myself.**

It might seem a little dramatic to say "School taught me to say nothing when I
saw injustice", but think about it. That's not so hard of a point to make.

I would NEVER stand for the treatment I recieved in 2nd grade now. I don't
respect the professors that treated me poorly. If my *boss* at *work* did that,
you can be sure I'd make some noise. But in a lecture hall, 1 of 140? You sit
down and shut up. Well, I just graduated from lecture halls. I'm in the *real
world* now.
