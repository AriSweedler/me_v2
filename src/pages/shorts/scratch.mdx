In elementary school, the system looks out for you. I'm not talking about
friends and family, I'm talking about teachers and the principal and stuff. If
you're messing up, they're on your side to try and get you to succeed.

This falls off a lil in middle school. Some teachers are disinterested - they
won't provide help, some faculty are incompetent - they can't provide help, and
some are just downright weird - the help they provides will harm more than
benefit.

Following this trend, you would expect to get more useless people in high
school. But this is where puberty starts happening, so you get treated
differently. Some kids are 6 feet tall. Some of them are big enough to win a
fight against a teacher. They drive. They own guns. Whether you like it or not,
the physical nature of students is changing.

The emotional changes tend to coincide, but for those kids unlucky enough to
mature emotionally before physically, it isn't until they start looking
different that they start getting the respect they deserve from these authority
figures.
